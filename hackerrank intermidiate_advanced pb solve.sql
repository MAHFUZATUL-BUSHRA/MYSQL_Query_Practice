/*Question:

You are designing a simple vending machine simulation.

Implement a class VendingMachine with the following behavior:

    The machine is initialized with a certain number of items and the price per item.

    Users can attempt to buy a specific number of items with a certain amount of money.

Write a method buy(req_items, money) that:

    Returns "Not enough items in the machine" if the requested quantity exceeds the remaining stock.

    Returns "Not enough coins" if the money provided is less than the total price.

    Otherwise, reduces the number of items in the machine and returns the change (i.e., money - total_price).

ðŸ“¥ Input:

    Number of items in the machine (integer)

    Price per item (integer)

    Multiple calls to buy(req_items, money)

ðŸ“¤ Output:

    A number (change) if the transaction is successful.

    A message if it fails due to lack of items or insufficient money.*/
    
   -- solution 
   
class VendingMachine:
    def __init__(self, num_items, item_price):
        self.numItems = num_items
        self.itemPrice = item_price

    def buy(self, req_items, money):
        total_price = req_items * self.itemPrice

        if req_items > self.numItems:
            return "Not enough items in the machine"

        if money < total_price:
            return "Not enough coins"

        self.numItems -= req_items
        return money - total_price


# Test Cases
vend = VendingMachine(200, 2)

print(vend.buy(50, 103))  # 50 * 2 = 100; 103 - 100 = 3 => Expected: 3
print(vend.buy(160, 400))  # Only 150 items left => Expected: "Not enough items in the machine"
print(vend.buy(43, 172))  # 43 * 2 = 86; 172 - 86 = 86 => Expected: 86
print(vend.buy(5, 3))  # 5 * 2 = 10; only 3 coins => Expected: "Not enough coins"
